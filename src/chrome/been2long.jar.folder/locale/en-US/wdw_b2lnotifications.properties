extensions.been2long@daynemay.description= Been2Long lets you specify, for each contact, a regularity with which you want to write that contact.  For example, you might want to write to John Doe once a week, but Jane Doe once every three days.  These values, and the reminder dates for each "next contact" are stored in custom fields ("Custom4" by default, configurable).
